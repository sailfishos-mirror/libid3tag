/** @page stability API and ABI Stability
 *
 * Across the same major versions of the library (e.g., 0.16, 0.17, etc), we
 * aim to keep both our API and ABI stable.
 *
 * Keep in mind that while we aim to maintain compatibility with programs built
 * against 0.15.1b, the 0.16.x series is ABI incompatible with the 0.15.1b
 * _with some exceptions_ (see @ref packaging_abi_incompatibilities for a
 * criteria of determining ABI compatibility if interested). This should be
 * expected as there is a difference between in major version numbers between
 * our fork versus the original upstream (0.16 versus 0.15).
 *
 * For the current 0.16.x releases, ABI compatibility is maintained.
