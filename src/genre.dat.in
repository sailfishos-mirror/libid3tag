/*
 * You almost certainly should *NOT* add entries to the above list.  Yes,
 * even if your favourite genre is missing and you *really* feel it belongs!
 *
 * In the now-ancient ID3v1 system, the genre was stored as an 8-bit value
 * representing the above fixed choices.  If you wanted a different option,
 * you were out of luck.
 *
 * Modern software uses a free-form string for the genre (via the "TCO"
 * frame type introduced in 1998's ID3v2.2.0, later the "TCON" type
 * starting with in 1999's ID3v2.3.0) so is not limited to any fixed set
 * of choices.
 *
 * The above list is only needed because that style of genre tag will
 * always exist in old files.  In addition, the TCO/TCON frames can refer
 * to the original genre entries by using parenthesised numbers (e.g. "(3)"
 * will expand to "Dance", perhaps after localisation).
 *
 * In any case, adding to this fixed list would only be useful if you could
 * get all other software that interprets ID3 tags to agree.  In effect, the
 * only ones that will ever be valid are the original 80 entries from the ID3v1
 * specification and 112 additions from Winamp between 1997 and 2010.
 *
 * For more information, see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ID3v1_genres
